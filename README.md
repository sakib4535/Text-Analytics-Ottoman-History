# Text-Analytics-Ottoman-History

Our journey through history and cutting-edge technology continues as we explore the legacy of the Ottoman Empire. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP), we delved into the pages of "The Ottoman Turks and the Routes of Oriental Trade," unraveling its historical secrets. Our primary goal was to extract names associated with the historical context, bringing the past to life.

The project, titled "Tracing Ottoman Emperors: A Text Analytics Journey," was an incredible success. We navigated through centuries of history, identifying key figures like Suleiman the Magnificent and learning about pivotal trade routes like the Levant. With the help of NLP techniques, we uncovered hidden gems in the text, enriching our understanding of the Ottoman Empire.

🌏 But our journey didn't stop there. We ventured into the realm of geography, identifying countries mentioned in the text, just as we did with individuals. Our text analytics prowess extended to visualizing results through a powerful ROC-AUC curve, assessing our model's classification capabilities.

📈 The results? We achieved an impressive accuracy of 85.1% and produced a beautiful ROC curve with an AUC of 0.86, showcasing the efficacy of our classification model. History and technology converged, opening new horizons for the exploration of historical texts.🔍
